## Why

Waste is undoubtedly still the country's biggest problem, and we still produce household waste daily. Household waste contributes almost __half__ the percentage of the entire waste production in Indonesia. Meanwhile only __10%__ that's being recycled, __60%__ ends up in landfills, and __30%__ is littered.

EcoCrafters is there to give you an easy guide to recycling any waste you have before throwing it away.
